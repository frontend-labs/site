= Share Buttons =

Our aim was to stray away from the "in the box" thinking behind most social bookmarking plugins, and add a little flair that would entice your readers, rather than deterring them with microscopic icons that get lost in pages heavy laden with content.

[Share Buttons](https://shareaholic.com/publishers/sharing/) (demo)

= Recommendations / Related Content =

Increase pageviews and engagement by highlighting relevant content from across your site to your readers who would not otherwise encounter them. Shareaholic is not just yet another related posts content plugin. It involves a simple installation that's easy to update and tweak. You'll be using well-engineered and optimized code that won't slow or block your pages from loading. You can choose between several themes to match your site's design and customize every pixel if you'd like. Optimized for mobile devices like the iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, Android mobile phones, and more!

= Social Analytics =

Shareaholic reports all of your important actionable social media metrics including popular pages on your website, referral channels, and who are making referrals and spreading your webpages on the internet on your behalf bringing you back more traffic and new visitors.

= Fast & Secure =

We use industry best practices to make our code as fast and unobtrusive as possible, meaning - for example - that the performance impact is comparable to adding Google Analytics to your site. Because all of the processing and collection runs on our servers and not yours, it doesn't cause any additional load on your hosting account. In addition, our JavaScript is hosted on Amazon's CDN to make fetching it as blazing fast and reliable as possible. In fact, it's one of the fastest proven analytics system, hosted or not hosted, that you can use.

Shareaholic is used and trusted by hundreds of thousands of websites like yours and touches almost 300 million people each month. Designed and built with all the love in the world in Boston, Massachusetts.

Note: The analytics portion of Shareaholic may use trusted 3rd party services like Google Analytics and AppNexus to enhance its data.

= Shareaholic Shortcode Support / Manual Usage =

You can place Share Buttons, Related Content and any other Shareaholic app manually wherever you're like. Simply insert the following Shortcode where you want the corresponding app to appear:

`[shareaholic app="share_buttons" id="<insert shareaholic app ID here>"]`
`[shareaholic app="recommendations" id="<insert shareaholic app ID here>"]`
`[shareaholic app="ad_spaces" id="<insert shareaholic app ID here>"]`
`[shareaholic app="follow_buttons" id="<insert shareaholic app ID here>"]`

Notes: optionally, you can also specify `title`, `link` or `summary` as Shareaholic shortcode parameters. If you don't specify these optional  parameters, the shortcode will automatically determine these values.

Example:

`[shareaholic app="recommendations" id="<insert shareaholic app ID here>" title="About Me" link="http://mysite.com/about"]`

In your PHP / theme template code, you would add:

`<?php echo do_shortcode ('[shareaholic app="share_buttons" id="<insert shareaholic app ID here>"]'); ?>`
`<?php echo do_shortcode ('[shareaholic app="recommendations" id="<insert shareaholic app ID here>"]'); ?>`
`<?php echo do_shortcode ('[shareaholic app="ad_spaces" id="<insert shareaholic app ID here>"]'); ?>`
`<?php echo do_shortcode ('[shareaholic app="follow_buttons" id="<insert shareaholic app ID here>"]'); ?>`

Grab the corresponding App ID from your Shareaholic Dashboard for the App you want to manually insert into your theme. If use double quotes ("'s) in your title or summary, make sure to encode them properly as `&quot;`

Shareaholic Shortcode's are full featured and support all available configuration options available. Enjoy!
